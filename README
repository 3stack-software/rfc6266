# rfc6266

This module implements parsing of Content-Disposition headers.
These headers are used when getting http resources for download;
they provide a hint of whether the file should be downloaded,
and of what filename to use when saving.

# Security

The content-disposition filename should be used with caution.
Do not let the sender overwrite an arbitrary filesystem location,
pick arbitrary extensions or filenames with special meaning,
pick filenames containing unusual or misleading characters, etc.
Read RFC 6266 section 4.3 for more details.

# Usage

`ContentDisposition.from_header` builds a ContentDisposition object
from the header value. Important attributes are disposition, filename.

This module only looks at Content-Disposition, if filename is None
you should look at the document location for a fallback.

# Compatibility

Currently tested under Python 2.7.

# Testing
