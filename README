# rfc6266

This module implements parsing of HTTP Content-Disposition headers.
These headers are used when getting resources for download;
they provide a hint of whether the file should be downloaded,
and of what filename to use when saving.

# Usage

## Receiver

`parse_headers` builds a `ContentDisposition` object from the header value.
The header can be complemented with fallbacks such as a location url.
Important attributes of `ContentDisposition` are `is_inline`,
`filename_unsafe`, `filename_sanitized`.

## Sender

`build_header` builds a header value from a filename.

# Security

The Content-Disposition filename should be used with caution.
Do not let the sender overwrite an arbitrary filesystem location,
pick arbitrary extensions or filenames with special meaning,
pick filenames containing unusual or misleading characters, etc.
Read RFC 6266 section 4.3 for more details.
